As of Summer 2016, we now have a Mac O\-S X Installer which greatly simplifies the process of installing T\-S\-G\-L on a Mac.

We wrapped it up in a .dmg file, which is located in the Git\-Hub repo.

We then compressed that .dmg file into a .tar.\-gz archive file to conserve space.

You can download that file \href{https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/blob/master/TSGLMac.tar.gz}{\tt here}.

Once you have downloaded that file, follow these instructions\-:

1). Uncompress the file, then place the .dmg file anywhere that'd you like (e.\-g. $\sim$/\-Desktop/).

2). Mount the .dmg file (double-\/click on it), and a new volume named \char`\"{}\-T\-S\-G\-L\char`\"{} should appear.

3). Open up the volume, and you should see a .pkg file named \char`\"{}\-Install\-T\-S\-G\-L\char`\"{}. Double-\/click on that file.

4). Follow the installation process, and T\-S\-G\-L should be installed on your Mac!
