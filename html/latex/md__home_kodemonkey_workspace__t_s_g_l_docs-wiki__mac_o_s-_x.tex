As of Summer 2016, we now have a Mac O\-S X Installer which greatly simplifies the process of installing T\-S\-G\-L on a Mac.

We wrapped it up in a {\ttfamily .dmg} file, which is located in the Git\-Hub repo.

You can download that file \href{https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/blob/master/MacBinInstaller/TSGL.dmg}{\tt here}.

Once you have downloaded that file, follow these instructions\-:

1). Uncompress the file, then place the {\ttfamily .dmg} file anywhere that'd you like (e.\-g. {\ttfamily $\sim$/\-Desktop/}).

2). Mount the {\ttfamily .dmg} file (double-\/click on it), and a new volume named {\ttfamily T\-S\-G\-L} should appear.

3). Open up the volume, and you should see a {\ttfamily .pkg} file named {\ttfamily Install\-T\-S\-G\-L}. Double-\/click on that file.

4). Read the {\ttfamily R\-E\-A\-D\-M\-E.\-txt} file, follow the installation process, and T\-S\-G\-L should be installed on your Mac!
