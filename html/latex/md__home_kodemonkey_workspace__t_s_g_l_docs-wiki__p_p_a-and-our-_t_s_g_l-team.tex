As of summer 2016, we currently have a P\-P\-A (Personal Package Archive) on \href{https://launchpad.net/}{\tt Launchpad} for our T\-S\-G\-L Debian packages.

You can visit our P\-P\-A by clicking \href{https://launchpad.net/~tsgl-test/+archive/ubuntu/tsgl-dev}{\tt here}.

We also have a moderated team which allows us to add users, like you, so that the Debian package can be updated by others.

You will, however, need a Launchpad account in order to be added to our team.

Follow the process as described \href{https://login.launchpad.net/+new_account}{\tt here} in order to create an account.

Once you create your account (and have validated your email), log into \href{https://launchpad.net/}{\tt Launchpad}.

Now, go to your profile (click on your username; it should be next to the {\ttfamily Log Out} button on the right corner of the webpage).

Now, on your profile page, you should see {\ttfamily Signed Ubuntu Code of Conduct\-:} somewhere. If you have created a new account, it should say {\ttfamily No}.

In order to sign packages, upload them to P\-P\-As, create your own P\-P\-As, etc., you'll have to sign that Code of Conduct.

If you already have done so, feel free to skip this section.
