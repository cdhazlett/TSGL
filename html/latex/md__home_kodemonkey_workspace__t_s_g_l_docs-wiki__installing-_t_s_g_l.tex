As of summer 2016, there are two main ways that you can install T\-S\-G\-L\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item via a binary package $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$(recommended)$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$.
\item directly from source.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In essence, the binary packages depend on a laundry list of dependencies.

The same is true when you install from source.

However, the three main dependencies are\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.freetype.org/download.html}{\tt Free\-Type}
\item \href{https://www.glfw.org/download.html}{\tt G\-L\-F\-W}
\item \href{https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/glew/glew/1.12.0/glew-1.12.0.zip}{\tt G\-L\-E\-W}
\end{DoxyItemize}

These, along with the other dependencies ({\ttfamily doxygen}, development header files, ...), are installed along with T\-S\-G\-L regardless of which method you choose.

When installing T\-S\-G\-L using a binary package on Ubuntu \& Fedora, the following is true\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Debian/\-Ubuntu\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Debian packages install {\ttfamily libfreetype6} and {\ttfamily libfreetype6-\/dev}. This resolves the Free\-Type dependency.
\item The Debian packages install {\ttfamily libglew-\/dev}. This resolves the G\-L\-E\-W dependency.
\item A packaged version of the {\ttfamily G\-L\-F\-W} library is installed along with the T\-S\-G\-L Debian packages. This resolves the G\-L\-F\-W dependency.
\item Please be sure to have $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$at least Open\-G\-L 3.\-0 or greater$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ on your machine. You can update your graphics drivers by typing the following command\-: {\ttfamily sudo ubuntu-\/drivers autoinstall}. If that does not work, there are plenty of online tutorials which should help you.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fedora/\-R\-P\-M\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The R\-P\-M package installs {\ttfamily freetype} and {\ttfamily freetype-\/devel}. This resolves the Free\-Type dependency.
\item The R\-P\-M package installs {\ttfamily glew} and {\ttfamily glew-\/devel}. This resolves the G\-L\-E\-W dependency.
\item A packaged version of the {\ttfamily G\-L\-F\-W} library (named {\ttfamily glfw\-T\-S\-G\-L}) is also installed along with T\-S\-G\-L. This resolves the G\-L\-F\-W dependency.
\item As with the Debian packages, please be sure to have $\ast$$\ast$$\ast$at least Open\-G\-L 3.\-0 or greater$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ on your machine!
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Given this, let's take a closer look at the ways you can install T\-S\-G\-L.
