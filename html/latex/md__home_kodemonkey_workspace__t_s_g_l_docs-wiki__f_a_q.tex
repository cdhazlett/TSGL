Welcome to the F\-A\-Q page! In here, we try to answer the most common questions that users may have in regards to T\-S\-G\-L.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ A test keeps crashing with the error \char`\"{}the font file could not be opened and read\char`\"{}! What do I do?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Are you in the bin folder of the tsgl folder? Some tests won't work unless you are in the bin folder. Specifically\-:

{\ttfamily test\-Blur\-Image}, {\ttfamily test\-Calc\-Pi}, {\ttfamily test\-Cosine\-Integral}, {\ttfamily test\-Get\-Pixels}, {\ttfamily test\-Greyscale}, {\ttfamily test\-Image}, {\ttfamily test\-Image\-Cart}, {\ttfamily test\-Inverter}, {\ttfamily test\-Mandelbrot}, {\ttfamily test\-Philosophers}, {\ttfamily test\-Progress\-Bar}, {\ttfamily test\-Spectrogram}, {\ttfamily test\-Text}, {\ttfamily test\-Text\-Cart}, {\ttfamily test\-Text\-Two}, {\ttfamily test\-Units}

If the test that keeps crashing is in the list above, go into the bin folder and execute it from there.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ What is the maximum number of threads I can use in Windows?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ You can only have up to 64 threads at a time in Windows.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Why won't my tsgl Solution build in Windows?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Have you built the tsgl project first? You must build that first in order to create the lib file for T\-S\-G\-L. Then, you can build the entire Solution.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Does T\-S\-G\-L have Debug messages in case things break?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ In fact it does. Check out the \href{http://calvin-cs.github.io/TSGL/html/_error_8h_source.html}{\tt Error.\-h} file and you will see a commented out line\-:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{comment}{//#define TSGL\_DEBUG}
\end{DoxyCode}


Uncommenting out this line will turn on Debug messages for the T\-S\-G\-L library in case things break (font not loading, image not found, etc...).

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ With which operating systems does T\-S\-G\-L work?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Good question! T\-S\-G\-L has been successfully tested on\-:

\paragraph*{Linux}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu 14.\-04 (Trusty Tahr)
\item Ubuntu 16.\-04 (Xenial Xerus)
\item Arch Linux
\end{DoxyItemize}

(With g++-\/4.8, g++-\/4.9, g++-\/5.1).

\paragraph*{Red Hat}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Cent\-O\-S 7
\item Fedora 24
\end{DoxyItemize}

(With g++-\/4.8).

\paragraph*{Windows}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Windows 7
\item Windows 10
\end{DoxyItemize}

(With Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2013, and Visual Studio 2015).

\paragraph*{Mac O\-S X}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mac\-O\-S 10.\-9.\-5 (Wrangler)
\item Mac\-O\-S 10.\-10.\-x (Yosemite)
\item Mac\-O\-S 10.\-11.\-x (El Capitan)
\end{DoxyItemize}

(With g++-\/4.8, g++4.9, g++-\/5).

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ How do I update the Doxygen pages? Or the Wiki pages? I found that a change needs to be made.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ I'm glad you asked! See the \mbox{[}\mbox{[}Doxygen and Wiki\mbox{]}\mbox{]} page.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ I'm an Ubuntu user. Is there a Debian package out there for T\-S\-G\-L?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Indeed there is! As of summer 2016, T\-S\-G\-L has a Debian package for easy installation. See the \mbox{[}\mbox{[}Debian (Aptitude)\mbox{]}\mbox{]} page.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ What about Red Hat users? Is there an R\-P\-M package?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Of course! See the \mbox{[}\mbox{[}R\-P\-M\mbox{]}\mbox{]} page!

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ So, if T\-S\-G\-L has a Debian package, and an R\-P\-M package, how do I create new ones?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Take a look at our \mbox{[}\mbox{[}Creating New Deb Packages\mbox{]}\mbox{]} and \mbox{[}\mbox{[}Creating New R\-P\-M Packages\mbox{]}\mbox{]} pages. However, it is not recommended, as the process for creating these packages has already been automated.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ A new version of Visual Studio has come out, but there's no T\-S\-G\-L Solution made! How do I create one?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Check out our \mbox{[}\mbox{[}New Visual Studio Versions\mbox{]}\mbox{]} page for detailed instructions on how to make a new Visual Studio Solution.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ What about a binary installer for Mac\-O\-S X? If I recall correctly, it was especially difficult to install T\-S\-G\-L on a Mac...

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Yes, the process was a tad bit difficult for Mac\-O\-S X users. Luckily, we have made a new Mac\-O\-S X .pkg Installer which automates the entire installation process. Take a look at the \mbox{[}\mbox{[}Mac\-O\-S X\mbox{]}\mbox{]} page. (There is also a refactored \href{https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/blob/master/install-mac}{\tt install-\/mac} script, if you wish to install T\-S\-G\-L from source agan).

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-Q\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ What about creating new Mac\-O\-S X .pkg Installers?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-A\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Excellent question! See the \mbox{[}\mbox{[}Creating New Mac\-O\-S X Packages\mbox{]}\mbox{]} page.
