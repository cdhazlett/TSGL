G\-C\-C version 4.\-9 supports version 4.\-0 of Open\-M\-P\href{https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/gcc-49-openmp-code-cannot-be-linked-with-intel-openmp-runtime}{\tt \textbackslash{}\mbox{[}1\textbackslash{}\mbox{]}}. This makes any code compiled with O\-M\-P before G\-C\-C 4.\-9 binary uncompatable with code compiled under 4.\-9 or higher. One error cause by this is something similar to {\ttfamily Undefined \char`\"{}\-G\-O\-M\-P\-\_\-parallel\char`\"{}}.

To resolve this error, you can either downgrade your compiler to G\-C\-C 4.\-8 or earlier, or recompile all O\-M\-P code under G\-C\-C 4.\-9 or later.
