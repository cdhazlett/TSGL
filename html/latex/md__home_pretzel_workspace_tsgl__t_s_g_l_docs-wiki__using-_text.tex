Placing text on a Canvas is pretty straight forward.

c.\+set\+Font() sets the font of the text to draw. ({\itshape N\+O\+T\+E\+:} If you ever want to draw text, make sure you set the font first! See the freetype folder located in the assets folder of the T\+S\+G\+L source code for available fonts.).

c.\+draw\+Text() draws text to the Canvas with the top left part of the text starting at (50, 150) and then it is drawn 20 pixels wide in black (B\+L\+A\+C\+K is a T\+S\+G\+L color constant. There are multiple color constants available such as R\+E\+D, B\+L\+U\+E, O\+R\+A\+N\+G\+E, and so on. We will take a look at these later.).
