So, you need to create a new Windows installer for T\-S\-G\-L.

This probably means that you also created a new Visual Studio solution for T\-S\-G\-L.

If not, please see \mbox{[}\mbox{[}New Visual Studio Versions\mbox{]}\mbox{]} {\itshape before} continuing.

Creating a new Windows installer isn't particularly difficult.

But it does require a tool called \char`\"{}\-Inno Setup\char`\"{}.

You can download the installer for it \href{http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php}{\tt here}.

Be sure to download the {\ttfamily innosetup-\/\#.\#.\#.exe} file from that website!

After downloading it, open it up.

Rename the installer to \char`\"{}install-\/windows\-V\-S$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{} and move it to the cloned T\-S\-G\-L workspace folder. Delete all files E\-X\-C\-E\-P\-T for the freetype6.\-dll and zlib.\-dll files. Rebuild Solution.
