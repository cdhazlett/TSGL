$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-N\-O\-T\-E\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ This page does {\itshape N\-O\-T} teach you how to create a new R\-P\-M package. It merely tells you how to update the R\-P\-M package that we currently have. {\bfseries If you would like to know how to create a new R\-P\-M package, please see \mbox{[}\mbox{[}Creating New R\-P\-M Packages\mbox{]}\mbox{]}}.

Take a look at the \href{https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/tree/master/Installers}{\tt Installers} folder located inside of our Git\-Hub repo.

You'll see that there are two items\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item a {\ttfamily debian} folder,
\item and the S\-P\-E\-C file for the T\-S\-G\-L R\-P\-M package.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The S\-P\-E\-C file is there because of how we automated the build of T\-S\-G\-L R\-P\-M packages using O\-B\-S.

It gets extracted from the downloaded Git\-Hub zip file on O\-B\-S, and then used to make the R\-P\-M package.

If you would like to update that file (perhaps a new dependency has been added, documentation, etc.), simply edit that file and make a Pull Request in order to merge the new changes.

(Or do a git add-\/commit-\/push, if you are allowed to do so).

The S\-P\-E\-C file changes and any changes to the source code will be integrated into the new R\-P\-M package.
