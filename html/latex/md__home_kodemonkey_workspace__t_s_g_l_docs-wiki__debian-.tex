$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\-N\-O\-T\-E\-:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ This page is for Ubuntu/\-Debian users. If you are a Fedora/\-Red\-Hat user, please see the \mbox{[}\mbox{[}R\-P\-M\mbox{]}\mbox{]} section!

As of Summer 2016, an aptitude/debian package has been made for T\-S\-G\-L for ease of installation. Packages have been made for the following Ubuntu distros\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu 14.\-04 (Trusty Tahr)
\item Ubuntu 16.\-04 (Xenial Xerus)
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you have one of those distros, you can use apt-\/get to install the T\-S\-G\-L library.

Follow these steps in order to get T\-S\-G\-L on your machine\-:

1). Type 'sudo add-\/apt-\/repository ppa\-:threadsafegraphics/tsgl-\/dev'.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When prompted, hit E\-N\-T\-E\-R.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2). Type 'sudo apt-\/get update'.

3). Type 'sudo apt-\/get install tsgl'.

T\-S\-G\-L will be installed along with a packaged version of the G\-L\-F\-W library. The generic Makefile for creating programs (as seen in the tutorials, i.\-e. \mbox{[}\mbox{[}Building Programs\mbox{]}\mbox{]}) is located in the G\-E\-N\-E\-R\-I\-C\-\_\-\-M\-A\-K\-E\-F\-I\-L\-E directory under /home/. Go into that directory, and copy over the Makefile into your project directory in order to start building applications that use T\-S\-G\-L. (See the tutorials for how to do so).
