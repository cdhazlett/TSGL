Found an issue with T\-S\-G\-L? Perhaps it's an annoying bug, or maybe it's a feature request. Maybe you have a question specific to one of the classes, or maybe you found a fix that another user might find particularly helpful.

Or perhaps you'd like to leave a review of the library as a whole.

Whatever tickles your fancy, click the \href{https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/issues}{\tt Issues} tab (it looks like a circle with an exclamation point (!) ) and you'll be taken to the \href{https://github.com/Calvin-CS/TSGL/issues}{\tt Issues} page of the repository.

We are currently using this as a makeshift review board as well as an issues page.

Create a \char`\"{}\-New Issue\char`\"{} on the page and mark it with the corresponding label.

Then, subscribe to the issue board and be sure to watch the repository in order to receive notifications of replies to your post.

We will check it out or someone else will for you!
