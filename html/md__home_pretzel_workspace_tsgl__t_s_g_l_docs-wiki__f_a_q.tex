Welcome to the F\+A\+Q page! In here, you can ask whatever burning question you have in regards to the library.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+Q\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ A test keeps crashing with the error \char`\"{}the font file could not be opened and read
\char`\"{}! What do I do?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+A\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Are you in the bin folder of the tsgl folder? Some tests won\textquotesingle{}t work unless you are in the bin folder. Specifically\+:

{\ttfamily test\+Blur\+Image}, {\ttfamily test\+Calc\+Pi}, {\ttfamily test\+Cosine\+Integral}, {\ttfamily test\+Get\+Pixels}, {\ttfamily test\+Greyscale}, {\ttfamily test\+Image}, {\ttfamily test\+Image\+Cart}, {\ttfamily test\+Inverter}, {\ttfamily test\+Mandelbrot}, {\ttfamily test\+Philosophers}, {\ttfamily test\+Progress\+Bar}, {\ttfamily test\+Spectrogram}, {\ttfamily test\+Text}, {\ttfamily test\+Text\+Cart}, {\ttfamily test\+Text\+Two}, {\ttfamily test\+Units}

If the test that keeps crashing is in the list above, go into the bin folder and execute it from there.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+Q\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ What is the maximum number of threads I can use in Windows?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+A\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ You can only have up to 64 threads at a time in Windows.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+Q\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Why won\textquotesingle{}t my tsgl Solution build in Windows?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+A\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Have you built the tsgl project first? You must build that first in order to create the lib file for T\+S\+G\+L. Then, you can build the entire Solution.

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+Q\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Does T\+S\+G\+L have Debug messages in case things break?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+A\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ In fact it does. Check out the \href{http://calvin-cs.github.io/TSGL/html/_error_8h_source.html}{\tt Error.\+h} file and you will see a commented out line\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{comment}{//#define TSGL\_DEBUG}
\end{DoxyCode}


Uncommenting out this line will turn on Debug messages for the T\+S\+G\+L library in case things break (font not loading, image not found, etc...).

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+Q\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ With which operating systems does T\+S\+G\+L work?

$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$\+A\+:$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Good question! T\+S\+G\+L has been sucessfully tested on\+: Ubuntu 14.\+0.\+4 and Arch Linux, Mac\+O\+S 10.\+9.\+5 (Wrangler) and Mac 10.\+10.\+x (Yosemite), using g++ 4.\+9 and 5.\+1. It has also been sucessfully tested on Windows 7 \& Windows 10, using Visual Studio 2012.
